# AP-Date-Diff-Calculator

Can be seen running here: https://youtu.be/awhZkC7KSmw 

This is a date difference calculator/countdown timer.
This program operates in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), so difference dates are not tuned to local time zones of user.

Due to the limitations of C/CS50, only a 32 bit integer can be stored for the time difference in seconds.
So, calculator is only accurate up to 68 YEAR(S) 35 DAY(S) 3 HOUR(S) 14 MINUTE(S), 8 SECOND(S) from/
current date to past and 17 YEAR(S) 255 DAY(S) 23 HOUR(S) 59 MINUTE(S), 59 SECOND(S) from current date
to future as of 4/24/20.

These times will slowly even out as time passes.

Program is written fully in C, through Harvard's CS50 IDE.
